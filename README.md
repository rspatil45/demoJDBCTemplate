## Spring Roo is a Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool that aims to deliver fast, and instant results focused on Spring web applications and newer Spring technologies. It allows us to generate boilerplate code and project structure for Spring applications with simple to use commands.
##Roo can be used as a standalone application running from the operating system command line. There's no requirement to use Eclipse, Spring Tool Suite (STS) or any other IDE; in fact, we can use any text editor to write code!
